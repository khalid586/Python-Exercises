# Problem 1: we can't create a variable called break. Because it is a keyword.
# Problem 2:
birthYear = 2000
currYear = 2022

age = currYear - birthYear
print(age)

# Problem 3:
firstName = 'Mohammad '
middleName = 'khalid '
lastName = 'abdullah'
fullName = firstName + middleName + lastName
print(fullName)

# Problem 4: record-one and record^one are invalid
